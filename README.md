# Udana HAWK Flight Controller

The Flight Controller Code for the Udana <b>HAWK</b> drone. The code is written in Arduino and allows the drone to self-stabilize
as well as respond to user input, but the code will soon cater for autonomous flight without the simulated keyboard input. Along with the essential drone components, the Adafruit LSM9DS1
sensor allows for both gyro and accelerometer readings that guide the drone given user input.

This is the first version of the flight controller for the drone as well.
